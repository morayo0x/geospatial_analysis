    "# Geospatial Data Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "This repository is based on Kaggle micro-course on geospatial data analysis and visualization using the *GeoPandas* library.\n",
    "\n",
    "### GeoPandas\n",
    "\n",
    "It is an open sourse library for manipulating geospatial data (viewed as geometric object) using Python. It makes this possible by extending the Pandas library for operations on geometric object.\n",
    "\n",
    "> it considers only cartesian plane *objects* such as point, curve, and a polygon as valid. Hence, a three dimensional representation of the data in a cartesian plane is considered invalid or more precisely, ignored in the analysis of the spatial data\n",
    "\n",
    "Underneath, it depends on two important library:\n",
    "- shapely: used for the \"analysis and manipulation of geometric objects on Cartesian plane (two-dimensional) through set-theoretic operations such as (union, intersections, complements, differences e.t.c.)\"\n",

    "## Shapely\n",
    "The geometric objects types used in shapely are:\n",
    "- point implemented by the Point class\n",
    "- collection of points is implemented by the MultiPoint class\n",
    "\n",
    "- Curve implemented by the LineString class\n",
    "- collection of points is implemented by the MultiLineString class\n",
    "\n",
    "- Surface implemented by the Polygon class\n",
    "- collection of surface is implemented by the MultiPolygon class\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> it is important to note that there are no smooth (or continous) curve in shapely"
